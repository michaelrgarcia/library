# library

This project will be a javascript-focused project involving the idea of prototype (object inheritance) and object constructors.

It will have an interactive interface and use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It will (temporarily) allow users to "keep track" of books they read by giving them the feature of adding books through a form.

I will most likely come back to this project later to add some sort of data storage for the user's options.
